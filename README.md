# hello, This is a LrcMaker.

## What is this?

> This tool allows you to tranform .txt lyric file into .lrc file, which includes timeline.
Of course, you should add the timeline by yourself. This tool aims to help you to add the timeline easier.

## Usage
1.Drag your lrc.txt into the same folder as main.py or main.exe. Then it's time to start. Simply click main.py, or main.exe, if you cannot open py file.

2.press SPACE and play your music in background. When a new line of the lrc begins, press C to cut.

3.Press V to finish, check the final lrc file out in the same directory(output.lrc).

## You need to know that...
The origin txt file must be UTF-8 encoded

Remember, the first line of of your lrc also needs your cutting!

Ha, when you pressed C, the :) will turn into :D

And 0.7s later, it will turn back into :)
then you can record the next one.

This special design aimed to avoid mistouch and double touch, even triple touch...
