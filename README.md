welcome!

this tool allows you to transport pure lyric file to .lrc file, which includes timeline.
of course, here's something u should do:


drag your lrc.txt into the same folder as main.py or main.exe

open main.py or main.exe, whatever

press SPACE and play your music

when here comes the lrc, press C to record(or cut)

!!remember, don't forget to press C before the first line of of your lrc!!

Ha, when u pressed C, the :) will turn into :D

and 0.7s later, it will turn back into :)

then you can record the next one.

This special design aimed to avoid mistouch and double touch, even triple touch...

aft you finished, simply press V to finish.

check the final lrc file out in the same directory.



enjoy this simple project! haha
