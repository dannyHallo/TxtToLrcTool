When he was a boy
he wanted to play
down by the sea
At age thirteen
everyday after school
he would always sail around the lake
All the people would stand and stare
as he sailed around with precision and care
With his bi-corner hat and the way he would stand
he looked just like a Navy man
All the townsfolk would gather and say, and sing away
Captain Albert Alexander
He'll be a brave seafarer someday
But that Captain Albert Alexander
He'll go down in the waves
By age twenty four
he had left the shore
and was sailing for the Queen
On a dark starry night
Albert awoke to the sound
of his Captain screaming as he was drowned
The Navy crew was taking a lick
pirates had invaded the ship
But Albert with one aimed harpoon
ignited their rum with a spark and soon
flames drove the pirates away
the Navy sang
Captain Albert Alexander
Saved his crew from pirate slaughter
But that Captain Albert Alexander
He'll go down in the water
Now everyone dance
Dance. Dance.
Twenty some odd years later
On his ship The Sea Slater
He sailed into a mass of blubber
Gazing up to the sky
stood a large walrus
that was a hundred stories high, it meant no harm
The walrus was in a great deal of pain
It suffered from a tusk with tooth decay
Albert threw his anchor 'round it's tusk
with a little bit of pulling it was out by dusk
The walrus thanked Albert and sang, as he sailed away
Captain Albert Alexander
Friend to sea urchin and me
But that Captain Albert Alexander
He'll go down in the sea
At a ripe old age lightning struck from the sky
and split Albert's vessel in two
One hundred men fled for their lives
on rafts across the ocean blue
Albert stood at the stern of his ship
A giant octopus had him in it's grip
A vortex of spiraling death below ripped
and sharks and electric eels all made the trip
to see Albert
sink to the bottom of the sea
Just before he went down
he called out to his crew
It's obvious that my time has come
I'll let this ending ensue
I've led an exciting nautical life it would seem
and there's no better end than a death by the sea
His crew sang
Captain Albert Alexander
He went down in the sea
But that Captain Albert Alexander
He'll go down in history
That Captain Albert Alexander
He went down in the sea
